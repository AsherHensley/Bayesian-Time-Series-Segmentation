# Nonparametric-Learning-for-Hidden-Markov-Models-with-Preferential-Attachment-Dynamics

This repositiory contains the code used to generate experimental results from the paper:

Hensley, Asher A., and Petar M. DjuriÄ‡. "Nonparametric learning for Hidden Markov Models with preferential attachment dynamics." Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP), 2017 IEEE International Conference on. IEEE, 2017.

(see \_PAPER.pdf)

To generate results, run MASTER.m

Note: This code requires the Statistics Toolbox
